## EXPERIENCE  

### Headspace – Senior Software Engineer  
**September 2022 – Present**  
SME and lead contributor on clinical scheduling systems, driving refactors and DevEx improvements across the organization.

- Currently leading a clinical scheduling refactor focused on reducing DB query volume and latency. Initial results show a reduction in queries per request from ~750 to ~25 and a drop in P95 response time from 14s to under 1s.  
- Led a full redesign of authentication for secure clinical notes, replacing a cumbersome GraphQL-based 2FA system with Okta-integrated JWTs. Introduced JWT minting at the GraphQL gateway layer and downstream verification with AWS KMS, eliminating user friction and enabling a seamless, secure login flow. Rolled out the system to 100% of clinicians on time, resolving daily login issues and improving usability.  
- Contributed to the design and implementation of async job queues for e-prescription data migration between platforms. Ensured high accuracy of sensitive records and completed the project on time before vendor contract expiration.  
- Leading an initiative to improve developer experience through internal tools and workflows, including shared PyCharm run configs, AI-assisted PR checks, and AWS-aware scripting for local development. Improved local Docker Compose database import time from 6 hours to 10 minutes.  
- Representing my pillar within the organization in a cross-functional initiative focused on maintaining shared internal libraries, aligning dependencies, and preventing critical risks such as forced database or language upgrades.  
- Coordinated critical incident response for a major client in under 2 weeks, aligning engineers and stakeholders on focused delivery goals.  

### Red Ventures – Senior Software Engineer  
**November 2021 – September 2022**  
Modernized high-traffic financial APIs and led internal platform improvements to boost developer velocity.

- Modernized legacy Laravel APIs and decoupled frontend logic to improve maintainability and testability across high-traffic systems.  
- Built internal tooling using Lando to standardize local development environments across projects, significantly reducing onboarding time and setup inconsistencies.  
- Introduced a headless CMS to decouple content management from deployment cycles, reducing developer involvement in content updates and accelerating marketing turnaround.  
- Built and iterated on Datadog dashboards and alerting to improve real-time visibility into app health, enabling faster diagnosis of latency issues and system errors.  
- Integrated AWS Textract to automate file parsing and improve the reliability of document-based workflows.  

### RE/MAX – Senior Software Engineer / Scrum Master  
**June 2020 – November 2021**  
Led platform modernization and CI/CD automation while serving dual roles as backend engineer and scrum master.

- Led infrastructure modernization by migrating legacy codebases to new Laravel APIs with CI/CD pipelines and test automation.  
- Delivered a customer-facing marketing portal (Laravel + Vue), improving usability and performance.  
- Migrated CMS to Prismic, enabling multilingual content editing and decoupling content from deployments.  
- Developed automated CI/CD pipelines as internal platform infrastructure to streamline deployments, enforce coding standards, and accelerate release velocity.  
- Facilitated Agile ceremonies and process improvements as Scrum Master while actively contributing as a full-time developer.  
- Mentored teammates and coordinated closely with leadership during a six-month management gap.  

### Bright Oak – Lead Engineer  
**June 2011 – August 2020** *(Part-time 2011–2015, Full-time 2015–2020)*  
Fostered engineering maturity as the sole technical lead at a digital agency, delivering custom full-stack solutions.  

- Introduced Laravel and transitioned legacy projects from procedural PHP and WordPress to MVC architecture.  
- Built CI/CD pipelines using Git, Laravel Envoyer, and other tooling to automate deployments and enforce coding standards.  
- Led architecture and implementation of multi-tenant lead dashboards, headless CMS platforms, and third-party integrations (e.g., Salesforce, QuickBooks).  
- Mentored a distributed engineering team across time zones, improving code quality and consistency by championing evolving technical standards and tooling practices.  
- Scoped and delivered full-stack solutions on compressed timelines, balancing client requirements with technical feasibility to ensure timely, high-quality delivery.  
- Built serverless infrastructure with Laravel Vapor and AWS Lambda for scalable delivery.  

### Early Career: Educator Turned Engineer  
Before becoming a full-time engineer, I spent over a decade teaching music and technology in Title I schools, where I learned to break down complex ideas for diverse learners and lead technology adoption initiatives. I began coding to automate grading and administrative tasks — a path that sparked a career-long passion for building systems that empower others.

- Built custom Python tooling to automate student feedback and grade syncing.  
- Led school-wide 1:1 Chromebook deployment and trained faculty on educational tech.  
- Developed communication and mentorship skills now used to lead cross-functional teams and onboard engineers.
